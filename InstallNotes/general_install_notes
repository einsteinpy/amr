GRChombo has been compiled and tested with gcc-4.9 and higher and
intel icc-16.0.3 and higher. For icc note that the gcc compatibility has to be set to gcc-4.9 or higher.

GRChombo requires c++ standard 14 or higher so the compiler should be invoked with -std=c++14 (or higher)

This folder also contains specific install notes for a collection of machines GRChombo has been run on.

To compile Chombo:
You should check out the adapted Chombo version from the git repository (currently GRChombo will not compile
with the standard version of Chombo). The installation parameters can be set in Make.defs.local in the folder
${CHOMBO_HOME}/mk/. This folder contains examples for Make.defs.local files for machines we have run GRChombo on.
Once the Make.defs.local file has been set just run "make all DIM=3 (or 2,4,5... if you are thus inclined) -j 32
(compiles in parallel on 32 ranks)" in the folder ${CHOMBO_HOME}. This will also compile the tests which is a good
thing to do once but subsequently it is faster to only compile the library by invoking "make lib DIM=3 -j 32".

To compile GRChombo:
Export CHOMBO_HOME (the path to the Chombo installation) and compile whathever example or test you want to
run by invoking make all DIM=3 (or 2,4,5... if you are thus inclined. This is the number of spatial dimensions) -j 32 (compiles in parallel on 32 ranks)
in the relevant directory. In addition, follow any other specific instructions for your machine in this folder.
